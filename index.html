        <h3>When we talk about web development, we talk about the real deal - CODE and not about website building software or content management tools like Wordpress, Wix, Jimdo... Yes, that is right - if Wordpress is all you know, you are not allowed to call yourself a Web developer. Don't get me wrong, I respect and admire quite a few people who have mastered Wordpress, but they are still Web designers, not Web developers</h3>

I was the same a few months ago and honestly, the beginning results in web development were astounding. I have painfully come to the realization that development is not confined to just showing beautiful things on a browser.</h4>
